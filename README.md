Tic-Tac-Toe is a one-week project I created for school as an intermediate coding challenge.
I wanted to familiarize myself with the StdDraw library in making 2D graphics for the classic game.
This project helped me grow more confident in coding Java and taught me more about fundamental graphics.

You can click any of the squares and play a game filled with Xs and Os all on your own.
